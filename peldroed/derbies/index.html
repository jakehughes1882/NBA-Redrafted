        <br>This is the top 40 players in terms of dribbles attempted per 90 minutes. Despite waning in age, Lionel Messi leads the charts in attempts per 90. Despite missing 4 and a half games, Neymar wasted no time in his short lived cameos to trail second behind Messi.

        In the coming months, and as PSG look to Neymar to lead them to glory this season, he will be taking the ball and running at opponents. However, this chart only describes attempts - who has completed the most dribbles?

        Looking at completed dribbles per 90 minutes, Lionel Messi’s lead over the rest of the competition extends. 
        <br>
        What is impressive about this, is not just the volume of attempts he is making, but how many are successful. 
        <br>
        Lionel Messi burst onto the scene nearly 15 years ago with his penchant for dribbling past defenders, and it’s nice to see all those years later, and adapting his game multiple times, that it’s still a big part of his game.
        <br>
        Even as he approaches his mid 30s, and as he physically degrades, he is still the most difficult player to disposes when he runs with the ball. 
        <br>
        A few other stand outs here are Ndombele, Emre Mor, and Vitolo who don’t feature highly in attempts, but jump up the rankings in completion. 
        <br>
        Unfortunately, only the first of these 3 will feature in the coming month(s).

        Denormalising the numbers, and looking only at the total number of dribbles, its not surprising to see Lionel Messi so
        far ahead of the rest of the pack.
        <br>
        While the next 3 players on the list were with teams that didn't qualify for the next stage, it will be exciting to watch on as Jadon Sancho, Houssem Aouar and Eden Hazard attempt to drift past defenders with the ball at their feet.

        <br>This is the top 40 players in terms of dribbles attempted per 90 minutes. Despite waning in age, Lionel Messi leads the charts in attempts per 90. Despite missing 4 and a half games, Neymar wasted no time in his short lived cameos to trail second behind Messi. 
        <br>
        In the coming months, and as PSG look to Neymar to lead them to glory this season, he will be taking the ball and running at opponents. However, this chart only describes attempts - who has completed the most dribbles?

        Looking at completed dribbles per 90 minutes, Lionel Messi’s lead over the rest of the competition extends. 
        <br>
        What is impressive about this, is not just the volume of attempts he is making, but how many are successful. 
        <br>
        Lionel Messi burst onto the scene nearly 15 years ago with his penchant for dribbling past defenders, and it’s nice to see all those years later, and adapting his game multiple times, that it’s still a big part of his game.
        <br>
        Even as he approaches his mid 30s, and as he physically degrades, he is still the most difficult player to disposes when he runs with the ball. 
        <br>
        A few other stand outs here are Ndombele, Emre Mor, and Vitolo who don’t feature highly in attempts, but jump up the rankings in completion. 
        <br>
        Unfortunately, only the first of these 3 will feature in the coming month(s).

        Denormalising the numbers, and looking only at the total number of dribbles, its not surprising to see Lionel Messi so
        far ahead of the rest of the pack.
        <br>
        While the next 3 players on the list were with teams that didn't qualify for the next stage, it will be exciting to watch on as Jadon Sancho, Houssem Aouar and Eden Hazard attempt to drift past defenders with the ball at their feet.
