    How Wales Might Benefit From a Delayed Euro 2020
</h2>

        On the 7th of March 2020, Welsh football twitter descended into despair as the news had spread that Joe Allen had ruptured his Achilles tendon, and would subsequently miss EURO 2020, leaving a gap in the heart of the Welsh side desperate to repeat the fortunes of the 2016 tournament 4 years prior.

        In hindsight, it seems deranged to think that Euro 2020 would go ahead as planned as COVID-19 swept through Europe and the rest of the planet. The pandemic disrupting not just football, and the wider sporting calendar, but the entire worldwide economy. At the time of writing, over 300,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19, with over 35,000 of those in the UK. I‚Äôd like to take an opportunity before I continue that this article expresses how the welsh national football may benefit from generally moving an international tournament, but extremely hesitant to say that anyone has really benefited from a pandemic that has yet to be fully contained and claimed the lives of so many. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Due to the disruption of the Euro 2020 tournament, and delay to June 2021, it looks like Joe Allen will have enough time to recover from a severe injury, and with good health permitting, will have the opportunity to represent Wales. For the uninitiated, Joe Allen has a cult-like status amongst many followers of the national team. Outsiders may only know him as a physically diminutive midfielder with passive, no thrill passing ability, but to Welsh fans, he‚Äôs seen as an energetic yet experienced athlete capable of covering every blade of the middle of the grass, and a player that brings a much-needed sense of calmness to a generally inexperienced young side. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Not just bolstered by the return of one of the experienced and irreplaceable pieces of the welsh midfield, Wales will generally be a stronger side in 12 months time. Anyone who has looked closely at the Welsh squad under Ryan Giggs‚Äô tenure will have noticed what has been fairly young selection strategy, capitalising on the excellent improvement by the FAW to develop the teams at youth level. In the past, and even during our more successful period around 2016, previous managers would be more likely to fill international squads with players that may be able to play a part should an injury arise, but would more than likely not complete for a place in the starting XI or feature throughout an entire qualifying campaign. Where David Cotterill would be selected in the past, Rabbi Matondo now occupies a place in the squad. Exposure to training and playing with world-class players like Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey can go a long way in developing a young player into a valuable squad member in the future. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As I mentioned, the FAW have done an excellent job in improving the national youth teams by improving the setup and quality of coaching, and also be widening the net to explore all of the players that can qualify to play for the national team. In qualifying, Wales routinely selected some of the youngest squads throughout the campaign. The chart below shows the average squad age, against the number of players aged 23 or less (at the time of writing) selected in a squad.
